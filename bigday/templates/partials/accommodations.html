             <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>
                Below is a brief list of recommendations on places to stay in Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                It is Canada Day weekend - a big deal! - so we do recommend reserving your accommodation early.
                Kelsey and Dain will be staying in the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, which is a great option if you can find a rental or B&B, though unfortunately it doesn't have a lot of big hotels.
            </p>
            <p>We will provide one shuttle from Hilton Garden Inn and a second shuttle from the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake to the venue.
            </p>

                        The <a href="http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ontario/hilton-garden-inn-niagara-on-the-lake-XLVNLGI/index.html">Hilton Garden Inn</a> is conveniently located just off the highway and very close to the wedding venue.
                        It is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                        We have a block of discounted rooms reserved there - use the code <code>LZW16</code> to get the group discount.

                        The White Oaks is very close to - and similar to - the Hilton Garden Inn.
                        We were unable to get a group rate so just make a normal booking through <a href="http://www.whiteoaksresort.com/index.html">their website</a>.

                        This is also a highly recommended and often more affordable option for those who don't mind something a bit more self-service.
